# Java Serializers

This is a quick-and-dirty, absolutely opinionated and very likely unfair comparison of serialization libraries in Java.

## Goals

* Be able to serialize **arbitrary** objects
* In an efficient, **binary** format
* **Without having to implement `Serializable`**
* The library should have a small footprint
* Performance is not critical

Because of the above, a few well-known frameworks are instantly disqualified:

* Avro, FlatBuffers, Protobuf, Thrift: they require upfront schema design
* CBOR, Ion: looks too low-level, arbitrary object graphs are hard
* GSON, Jackson XML/JSON, Jettison, etc.: they emit text

## Sample data

See [Samples](src/main/java/org/ogreg/serializers/Samples.java) - the library should be able to deserialize an arbitrarily complex, but reasonably
sized object graph.

## Evaluation
