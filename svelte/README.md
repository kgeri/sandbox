# Svelte sandbox

I just love how simple yet elegant and powerful http://svelte.dev is.
I'm a backend developer abhorred by the accidental and ever-growing complexities of the JavaScript and CSS world, but every once in a while get fascinated by user interfaces.

This part of the repo has some samples and experiments that I spent some time on.

* [Treemap](src/Treemap.svelte) is integrating the wonderful http://d3js.org with Svelte
